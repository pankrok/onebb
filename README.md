## Inspiration
OneBB was created because there was no alternative for the shallow solutions such as IPB at a level that would meet my expectations. After long development of OneBB precursor - Boards script I decided to close this project due to limitations of choosing SLIM framework. The experience I gained helped me to create better, faster and more modern CMS for discussion forums.
