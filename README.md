OneBB is an open source discussion forum software. It was created as an alternative to current free solutions which did not meet my expectations.
OneBB is designed to be easy and convenient to use regardless of the device the user is using.

## Inspiration
OneBB was created because there was no alternative for the shallow solutions such as IPB at a level that would meet my expectations. After long development of OneBB precursor - Boards script I decided to close this project due to limitations of choosing SLIM framework. The experience I gained helped me to create better, faster and more modern CMS for discussion forums.
